### Merged Overview

Your project focuses on developing a system for the Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO to optimize the selection process of interview board members. The goal is to match subject experts with interview board subjects and candidates' areas of expertise, providing a matching score and predicting the suitability of experts using a relevancy score.

### Features to Include

1. **Profile Management:**
   - **Expert Profiles:** 
     - Create and store expert profiles with details like domain expertise, qualifications, experience, and past interview participation.
     - Implement a tagging system to categorize experts' specializations.
   - **Candidate Profiles:**
     - Store candidate profiles with their educational background, research areas, and other relevant information.
     - Use NLP techniques to analyze text data from candidates and experts.

2. **Interview Board Management:**
   - **Automated Board Selection:**
     - Create and manage interview boards with specific subjects or domains.
     - Automatically generate interview boards by selecting experts with the highest relevancy scores.
   - **Manual Overrides:**
     - Allow administrators to manually adjust the board composition, with system recommendations.

3. **Matching Algorithm:**
   - **Domain Matching:**
     - Develop an algorithm to match expert profiles with interview board subjects and candidate areas of expertise.
   - **Relevancy Scoring:**
     - Implement a scoring system to calculate the relevancy score for each expert, integrating profile scores with specific interview requirements.

4. **Profile Score Calculation:**
   - Design a method to determine the profile score for experts based on their alignment with candidates' profiles.

5. **Recommendation System:**
   - Create a recommendation engine that suggests the most suitable experts for each interview board based on relevancy scores.

6. **Reporting and Analytics:**
   - **Detailed Reports:**
     - Generate reports on expert-board matches, expert performance, and historical data.
   - **Performance Analytics:**
     - Track the performance of experts in interviews and refine the matching algorithm.

7. **User Interface:**
   - **Admin Dashboard:**
     - Provide an intuitive dashboard for managing experts, candidates, and interview boards.
   - **Expert Portal:**
     - Allow experts to view and update their profiles and review past interview engagements.
   - **Interactive Visualization:**
     - Implement data visualization tools to present scores and analytics effectively.

8. **Security and Compliance:**
   - **Data Security:**
     - Ensure the system complies with data protection regulations and secures sensitive information.
   - **Access Control:**
     - Implement role-based access control to restrict access to authorized personnel only.

9. **Integration with Existing Systems:**
   - **DRDO Systems Integration:**
     - Ensure compatibility and integration with existing DRDO systems, such as databases and HR systems.

### Technical Aspects

1. **Database Design:**
   - **MongoDB:** 
     - Use MongoDB for storing structured and unstructured data like expert profiles, candidate profiles, and scoring data.
     - Implement indexing and optimization techniques to handle complex queries.
   - **Relational Database (Optional):**
     - Consider using PostgreSQL or MySQL for structured data with flexible schema requirements.

2. **Machine Learning and AI:**
   - **Matching and Relevancy Scoring:**
     - Implement machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, random forests) to predict relevancy scores.
     - Use NLP techniques to analyze and match domain-specific keywords from expert profiles and candidate data.
   - **Multimodal AI:**
     - Use multimodal AI to analyze text and images from profiles and documents, utilizing models like CLIP for aligning textual and visual information.
   - **Recommendation System:**
     - Implement advanced matching algorithms using libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

3. **Frontend Development:**
   - **React.js:** 
     - Develop a responsive web application using React.js.
     - Implement data visualization libraries (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js) for displaying matching scores and analytics.

4. **Backend Development:**
   - **Express.js:** 
     - Use Express.js to manage business logic, user authentication, and API integrations.
     - Implement RESTful APIs for data management and communication between frontend and backend.

5. **Security Measures:**
   - **Authentication and Authorization:** 
     - Implement OAuth2 or JWT for secure authentication and role-based access control.
   - **Data Encryption:** 
     - Encrypt sensitive data storage and communication.

6. **Cloud Deployment:**
   - **Scalability and Reliability:** 
     - Deploy the application on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
     - Use Docker for containerization to facilitate deployment and scaling.

7. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI for automated testing, building, and deployment.

### Summary

By merging the key elements of both overviews, your MERN-based project will be a robust and scalable solution for the RAC under DRDO. The integration of AI, including multimodal AI, will enhance the system's ability to match experts with interview boards, ensuring a data-driven approach to the recruitment and assessment process.
